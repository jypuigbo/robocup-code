#Go to states that the Robot will move from one room to another
#Maybe should also be defined the function 'explore'
#Go to room is generated dynamically in function of the possible rooms that the robot knows that exist
#Go to person is predefined and checks if a person is in a location, so it can go to that location to find that person (it seems logic to go to the location where a person is located if you stored where s/he was
