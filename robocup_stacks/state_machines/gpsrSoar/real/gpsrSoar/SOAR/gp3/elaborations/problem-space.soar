## Elaborate the state with the problem space 
##   and information on how to make copies for look-ahead
##   two-level-attributes are copy not just the jug, but also the substructure.
##   This avoids have the substate modify the same jug structure as in the top state.
##   Empty is not copied because it is computed via an elaboration
