#This is a MOCK package made of two elements, both related to the speech recognition package ASR.

	1)Service:

	version 2.0:
	Now we have a server that just print on screen what you send him as
	configuration data. Just because there is no Response in the new Service.
	The client just sends mock-configuration data to the server.

	Warning: there are still pieces of old code laying around. I'll try
	to clean up as soon as possible.

	version 1.0:
	--This is made of a service of two messages ( a request and a response ).
	Both have the same structure, made of five strings ( except the last one
	which is a bool in the Request ). These five strings correspond to
	basic parameters for a correct Speech recognition. 
	What it does is when you send the 5 configuration data, the service answers
	confirming that your data was recieved.  

	2)Topic: Usersaid.
	--This is made up of basically  a message type named asrresult.msg and 
	a node named usersaid_publisher.py. It writes on the topic 'usersaid'
	every second ( 1 second seemed the minimum rate that a speech recognition
	can work). In it it writes in the corresponding variables:
		a)ssml = 'This parrot is no more!'
		b)confidence =2(The system is pretty sure of what the speaker said)
		c)start = 0
		d)end = 1
	There's also a reader implemented in order to test the topic publisher itself.
