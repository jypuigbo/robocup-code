This module provides two mock implementations for testing REEM@IRI code:

 * Person Detector Publisher

   $ python src/person_detector.py
   $ rostopic echo /closestPerson

   Publishes a message with 1Hz frequency to topic /closestPerson indicating
   that a person is stationary at position (10, 10).

   The message is of type person_detector.msg.peopleTracking.

 * Person Detector Service

   $ python src/person_detector_service.py
   $ rosservice call /detectPeople

   Returns a person_detector.msg.peopleTrackingArray message containing between
   zero and seven peopleTracking elements with random values (position between
   0 and 100, velocity between 0 and 10, variances between 0 and 1).
