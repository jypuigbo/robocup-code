============

Robocup code generated by students in collaboration with PAL-Robotics for the Robocup contests

============

This code was first created by the team of REEM@IRI (http://robocup.pal-robotics.com/ team blog).

In pal_smach_utils you will find little states and tools useful for the robot (a topic reader state, for example) for using it's basic skills (navigate to a location for example).

In robocup_stacks you will find different tools and the documentation generator for the state machines developed for the Robocup 2013.

The final state machines are in the folder called state_machines in robocup_stacks where you can also find "subsm_tests" where parts of the state machines are tested separately.

The folders are quite "dirty" right now. Clean up will be made while working with the code as we standarize and comment it.
